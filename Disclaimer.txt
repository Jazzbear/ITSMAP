DISCLIAMER!!!!!! I used these sites/examples to help me create my stock class:
* https://en.proft.me/2017/02/28/pass-object-between-activities-android-parcelable/
* http://www.parcelabler.com/ 

And for the rest of the code i used mostly the android developer guides and some stackoverflow posts to help
understanding the use of some of the elements like how to set errors in EditText and such.
